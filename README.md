# mmmBOT!
mmmBOT! is a work-in-progress Discord bot for my Marvel Contest of Champions alliance, the Assgardians. It was build using Node.js, Discord.js and Discord.js-Commando.

It includes some basic commands, plus many specific to MCOC gameplay. The MCOC commands pull for a Google Sheet "Database". This sheet was built from data pull from throughout the MCOC community, including:
* https://github.com/gabriel-hook/contest-of-champions (Synergies, Specials)
* https://github.com/Alsciende/tags/ (Game Tags)
* http://marveltrucos.x10.mx (PI, Basic Calendar + many of the Content Imgs)
* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1beR2CAlBQ2XBA3M1jJ1aPEfwE46eQt6LU-lzA0babxQ/edit#gid=1066535507 (Seatin Rank & Ability Tags)
* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/165oQ_fihXmJk12-RwHzyDq66KkVS4W0yILnjrjRdnKw/edit#gid=1446992372 (Sig Ability Values)

I'll add an install link if I ever decide it's ready for public use.
